<h4>Lionel Messi is the all-time leading player with most Ballon d’Or awards. He has won the award in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019 and 2021. Among his long list of achievements, this is perhaps the most impressive. It is a record that may never get broken due to Messi’s longevity and consistency at the top level. All of his Ballon d’Or wins came during his FC Barcelona days and the Argentine is yet to win one while representing Paris Saint-Germain.</h4>

<h4>With a 30-yard free-kick, Zlatan Ibrahimovic put his side up 3-2 against England to complete the hat trick. But the fourth goal topped it off. In one of the most ridiculous goals of all-time, Ibrahimovic scored a 30-yard overhead kick that has been on replay around the world ever since.<h4>
