Rules of Football (Soccer) | How it is Played?
</h2>

<h5>Football (Soccer) is the most popular game in the world. No matter where ever you are living, it is impossible that you haven’t come across this game yet. The world’s most expensive game has no borders, it is equally popular in underdeveloped countries of Africa as it is in European countries.</h5>

<h5>One of the most admitted stories says the game was developed in England, back in the 12th century. Though it wasn’t exactly football but games resembling football were played on meadows and roads in England. Alongside kicking, players were allowed to punch or kick each other. It was a bit of rugby, and a bit of football, but this is where it all began. Whatever it was, it was dangerous for sure.</5>

<h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
<h5>Like every game has some way of choosing the winner, some have points scoring while some have runs. In soccer, we have goals. The more goals a team scores the more it has chances of winning the game. Every goal takes a lot of hassle and effort, it is not easy, therefore only 2-3 goals are scored by each side in every game on average.</h5>

<h2>An Overview of Rules in Football</h2>
<h5>Each team can feature 11 players including the goalkeeper.
The whole play takes place in two different halves with each half of 45 minute. After the first half, players take a 15 minutes break to pull themselves together.
You can name up to 7 substitute players and substitution can be made anytime during the play. Only 3 substitutes can play at a time and if your 3 substitutes are already playing and you have a player injured, you’ll be forced to play without a replacement for the injured player.
There are some restrictions on what kind of football ball is to be used on the field. The ball must be of circular shape and has circumference of 58-61 cm.
The size of the pitch must be within 100-130 yards in length and 50-100 yards wide.
Free kicks, penalties, and throw ins are declared by the referees, you can’t argue with them. Spotting off side and throw ins is the assistant referee’s job, after watching, he tells the main referee what actually happened there to reach the right decision.
A football game can be drawn if both the teams have equal points. While in knock-out games, or if having a winner is mandatory, then the match can be decided on extra time and then in the penalty shots if the score remains the same during the extra 15 minutes.
Football has strict rules and a player who commits foul is either shown a yellow card or red card by the referee, if the foul is severe. Yellow card is a warning while a red card tells the player that he is dismissed. Two yellow cards equal one red and if the player has been sent off once, he can’t come back on the field during further play.</h5>


<h2>Roles of Players in Football</h2>
<h5>Each team features 11 players along with the goal keeper who’s restricted to the goal post and his job is to defend the post. A professional football team has players with these roles:
Goalkeeper − You can be a football player who can play in any position but not a goalkeeper. Goalkeeping is a tough job and therefore, only a specialist is chosen for this job. A keeper can’t go outside the rectangular penalty area which is 18 yards away from the goal and he holds the unique privilege of being allowed to use his hands to stop or hold the ball.
Defenders – As the name suggests, a defender is supposed to defend the goal. But the difference is, he can’t touch the ball with his hands like a keeper and he stays positioned in front of the goalkeeper to tackle any opposition player with the ball marching towards the goalpost.
Outside Fullbacks – These players stay on the right and left flanks and block the incoming opposition players with the ball. They don’t move much from their positions.
Central Defenders – They have a big role to play in the centre of the field and are supposed to cover the goal scorer of the opposition’s team.
Midfielders – They are versatile players as they form the link between the defenders and attackers. These players are physically fit and stronger than other players on the field because they have to run more than anyone else in the field. They enter the opposing team’s area to attack and they defend when the opposing team retains the ball.
Forwards – Another very important position that is taken care of by fast athletes. A player who plays at Forwards aims to create goals and create an easy situation for their teammates to score a goal.
Center Forwards – They are also called strikers. Their instinct level is of supreme level. Strikers attack the opposition’s goal post and try to score as many goals as possible.</h5>
